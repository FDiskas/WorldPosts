# WorldPosts
WPF app that loads a 100 random posts

## Context

This application was build as an assessment task.
It does not meet the requirements by one point: it does not contain a 10x10 grid, but instead a 4x25 grid.
That was done on purpose just for visual representation reasons, as 10x10 grid wasn't looking too great :)
